# musubi-tuner-gui
GUI for the new musubi-tuner

Anyone who want to contribute to the GUI code are welcome. I will make this one use uv: https://github.com/astral-sh/uv as the python package manager to facilitate cross platform use. Will aim to support Linux and Windows. Not sure about MacOS. Those interested to the MacOS support side are welcome to contribute code to ensure proper support.

Work until a viable Minimum Viable Product is ready will be found in the dev branch. Main will remain empty until contributors feel there is something work merging for a 1st release.
